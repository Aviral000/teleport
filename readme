This is a react app for fetching the text handler
build on webpack bundler
I use styling library(Material UI), SASS, react-quill and others

I make use of local storage and formatted data is also saved in local storage

I use the drag and drop functionality from the very scratch (i prefer to use draggrable library, but i believe in more optimised design drag and drop may lead to disturbance in the design work flow of the DOM)

because of small scale data transferring i prefer to use the prop drilling, because state management is simple in this project and not too logical. Otherwise ContextAPI will be good in this context as well.

I also provide some additional feature like category searcher and search bar to find the text board much faster than usual
Also #important and #todo given more priority than other plain text while doing category search.

how to run:
1. clone everything and just type 'npm start' in terimal
2. i also provided the deploy Link in the github repo itself
3. Direct url - https://teleport-cyan.vercel.app/
