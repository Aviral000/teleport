This is a react app for fetching the pet data
build on webpack bundler
instead of using the external libraries i used the SASS

i also write the service file just in case:
i didnt use it in my code because i also wrote everything before coming to the idea of service file, but just in case i also write the service file for "STATIC API CALL AND REQUESTS"

how to run:
1. clone everything and just type 'npm start' in terimal
