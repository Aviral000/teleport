This is a react app for fetching the text handler
build on webpack bundler
I use styling library(Material UI), SASS, react-quill and others

I make use of local storage and formatted data is also saved in local storage

I use the drag and drop functionality from the very scratch (i prefer to use draggrable library, but i believe in more optimised design drag and drop may lead to disturbance in the design work flow of the DOM)

how to run:
1. clone everything and just type 'npm start' in terimal
